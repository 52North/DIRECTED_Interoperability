# Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **DIRECTED Project Interoperability Part**. This repository contains a collection of demonstrative Jupyter notebooks that illustrate how to utilize different input and output data with various tools in the project. These notebooks serve as a guide for constructing the API to the data fabric in WP5 and demonstrate how different tools can be coupled to support the RWL use-cases in WP2.


## Contributions

We encourage team members to contribute by adding notebooks that demonstrate how your tools can integrate with the existing ones. 

## Access to Input Data

The input data necessary for these demonstrations is stored in NEXTCLOUD. You can download it using the following link:
